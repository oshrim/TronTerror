<h1>Tron Terror 
<h4>a really fun and addictive Java game for 2 players...</h>

the game was written in a few days, back in the day (young Java student) , and I just found it recently.
this source code could maybe help the student (beginners) to learn more about <b>Timers, Exceptions and 
Animation </b>at the lowest level.

Development has been stopped 2 years ago (!), though if you want to tweak it around you are more than welcome!

Note: with a few minor bugs..

<h5>enjoy!
